\### A Simple MCP Hello Server



`hello\_mcp` is a basic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server built using Python.  

It exposes a simple tool that returns a greeting message.



This project is mainly created to understand:

\- How MCP servers work

\- How tools are defined and exposed

\- Basic request → response flow in MCP
